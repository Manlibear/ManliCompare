# ManliCompare
Comparing gear stats to your off specs, so you don't have to!

`x` - This gear has no stat that you're tracking, useless for that spec

`[E]` -  This is either equipped by that spec currently or perfectly equal to what is


# Installation
Copy the `ManliCompare-master` folder to the AddOns directory (`~\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns`) and restart the game if it's running

# Alpha Test
This is a pretty early concept, so things to bear in mind:

- I just want test stat comparison right now, so this won't work with dual wielding and will only compare against the first ring and first trinket, these need a special case once I know the maths ain't wrong.

- Only change your spec, don't change your equipment sets manually, I have no idea what will happen but I'm pretty sure it won't be good.

- This will overwrite any equipment sets you have that are named the same as a spec, either rename, back up or be okay with losing your equipment sets.

- There is no user options menu (Yetâ„¢) so be sure to let me know the class, specs and stats you'll be using (weights can be found on Noxxic or decide yourself)

- As above, you will need to create an equipment set for each of the specs you want to compare, if you don't have an equipment set with the same name as a spec it *should* ignore it. Note: these equipment sets will auto update as you change gear. Also, set these equipment sets to auto equip on spec change by right clicking on the set and choosing your spec.

- if the comparison seems wrong in any way, either create an issue on here or run `/manlicompare reset` to start over
